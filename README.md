## Basic Info

The TechLadies Bootcamp starts with a series of Pre-Bootcamp Workshops, open to anyone, that focus on introducing basic concepts relevant to web development and software in general.

Following this, prospective participants of the Bootcamp will complete a Technical Task to be assessed on their suitability for admission to the Bootcamp.

8 successful participants will be paired up with professionals from the industry, who will guide them for 15 weeks, building a web-based project. At the end of the Bootcamp, there will be additional coaching focused on helping participants transit into a career in tech. Topics covered will include CV and interview preparation.

### Bootcamp

The Bootcamp will begin on October 9 and last until 15 January. There will be a 2 week break at the end of the year (week of December 20 and week of December 27). Participants will be expected to cater time for a 1-1 session with their coach once a week for about 4-5 hours. In addition, participants will need to spend time on their own during the week to complete the weekly project goals. Coaches will be available on Slack for ad hoc queries during the week. In addition to the Coach contact time, there will be selected workshops designed to facilitate completion of certain aspects of the project.

## Technical Task

To apply for the Bootcamp, prospective participants will need to complete a Technical Task to help the Bootcamp Team evaluate their technical capabilities. The Pre-Bootcamp Workshops, together with the Code Clinic are designed to help participants complete the Technical Task, and attendance is highly recommended.

The deadline for the Technical Task will be September 4, giving applicants enough time after the Code Clinic to make finishing touches. After the deadline, the Bootcamp Team will review submissions and select the 8 Bootcamp participants. Everyone who made a Technical Task submission will be notified on or shortly after **September 25**.

There are 2 Tasks available (only 1 needs to be completed):

### Frontend Technical Task

Make a visual website that shows how much you know about building websites. You are highly recommended to use ReactJS to build the app, as you will use this framework during the Bootcamp. The site should have the following features:

- An **About Me** page with a few paragraphs describing who you are, why you want to be part of the TechLadies Bootcamp, and at least 1 image.
- A **Contact Me** page with info about how to reach you online (e.g. LinkedIn, GitHub, Twitter).
- A Navigation bar which allows visitors to navigate between the 2 pages.

#### Stretch Goal

> You do not need to do this, and you will not be marked down for not completing this section

- Use the Weather Forecast Public APIs to add a weather forecase page to the website.
- The weather information should reside on a separate page in the website. How to display the information is up to you.

### Backend Technical Task

Build a JSON REST API using NodeJS, Express and Postgres. The API should be able to save and retrieve the following details to/from a local database:

- Basic user information such as **name** and **description/bio**.
- User contact information such as links to online presence (e.g. LinkedIn, GitHub, Twitter).

#### Stretch Goal

> You do not need to do this, and you will not be marked down for not completing this section

- Ensure the API can only be called if an API key is sent by the user calling the API.
- Verify that the API key matches a known value, to prevent people sending any value.

### Submission

Participants will need to share the source code of their submission for evaluation. Available methods are:

- Push the code to GitHub or BitBucket (both have free tier usage).
- Upload the source code in a zip file to Dropbox or Google Drive.

After uploading the source code, fill up the application form before the deadline on September 4.
